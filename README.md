This GitHub repository contains the code for a Netflix clone website created purely with HTML and CSS. The project aims to replicate the user interface and design of the popular streaming platform Netflix using only front-end web technologies.

Features:

    Responsive design: The website is designed to be responsive and adapt to various screen sizes, ensuring a seamless viewing experience across devices.
    Homepage layout: Mimics the layout of the Netflix homepage, featuring sections for trending movies and TV shows, recommended content, and more.
    Navigation menu: Includes a navigation menu similar to Netflix for easy access to different categories and sections of the website.
    Movie and TV show listings: Displays thumbnail images and titles of available movies and TV shows, organized in a grid layout reminiscent of Netflix's browsing experience.
    Hover effects: Incorporates hover effects on thumbnails to provide visual feedback and enhance user interaction.
    CSS styling: Utilizes CSS for styling and layout purposes, with clean and organized code for easy customization and maintenance.

Note: This project is for educational purposes and serves as a demonstration of HTML and CSS skills in replicating a real-world website design. It does not include any back-end functionality for streaming content or user authentication.
